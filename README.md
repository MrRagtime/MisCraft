**This will most likey be in alpha stages for sometimes.**

A Skript for Minecraft that adds Witchcraft!

Note, there won't be a new version until I add Witch Huts, Poppets and possibly more.

Please don't judge yet! I've only made very little progress and I barly even know anything about Witchcraft.

# Inspiration

Manly from WitcheryX but I've gotten some ideas from both, Bewitchment and Witchery.

# Do I, **Mr. Ragtime** even have permission from those authors?

Short answer is no, the author of Bewitchment never or ever will reply back and the chery on top is Witchery's author has disappeared.

No need to ask the author of WitcheryX because that is based off of Witchery.

# Where can I send a suggetion?

I'm free to take suggestions anytime and it don't matter where.

**Don't DM me on Discord for suggestions since my DMs are closed as of right now.**
